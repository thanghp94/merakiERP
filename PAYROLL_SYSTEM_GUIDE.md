## Salary Calculation Example

For an employee with:
- Base salary: 15,000,000 VND
- Working days: 24/26
- Allowances: 1,000,000 VND
- 2 dependents

**Calculation:**
1. **Proportional Salary**: (15,000,000 √∑ 26) √ó 24 = 13,846,154 VND
2. **Gross Salary**: 13,846,154 + 1,000,000 = 14,846,154 VND
3. **Social Insurance**: 
   - BHXH: 14,846,154 √ó 8% = 1,187,692 VND
   - BHYT: 14,846,154 √ó 1.5% = 222,692 VND
   - BHTN: 14,846,154 √ó 1% = 148,462 VND
4. **Taxable Income**: 14,846,154 - 1,558,846 = 13,287,308 VND
5. **Income Tax**: Progressive calculation with 2 dependents
6. **Net Salary**: Gross - Social Insurance - Income Tax - Other Deductions

## Integration with Invoice System

The payroll system automatically creates invoices for salary payments:

- **Invoice Type**: `payroll`
- **Is Income**: `false` (expense for company)
- **Invoice Items**: Detailed breakdown of salary components
